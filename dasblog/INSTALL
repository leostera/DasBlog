	"django.core.context_processors.i18n",
	"django.core.context_processors.media",

	"blog.dasblog.context_processors.common_forms")

	# Import module specific settings
	from dasblog.settings import *

and add both this app and the django.contrib.comments to your installed apps.
	# DasBlog
    'django.contrib.comments',
    'blog.dasblog',
